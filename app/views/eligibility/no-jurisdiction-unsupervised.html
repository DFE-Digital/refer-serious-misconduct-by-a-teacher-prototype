    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why you cannot refer them using this service</h2>

    <p>Cases of serious misconduct must be related to teachers who are (or have been) employed or engaged at:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a school in England</li>
      <li>a sixth form college in England</li>
      <li>relevant youth accommodation in England</li>
      <li>a children’s home in England</li>
      <li>a 16 to 19 Academy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This does not include cases relating to teaching assistants, higher level teaching assistants or other support staff.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reporting someone who is not a teacher</h2>
