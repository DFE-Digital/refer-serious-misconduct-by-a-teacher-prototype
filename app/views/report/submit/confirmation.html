    <p>If we’ve not made a decision whether to investigate your referral within 14 days of receiving it, we’ll send you an email to let you know.</p>

    <p>We could tell you that we:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>need more information to decide whether to investigate the case</li>
      <li>will not investigate the case because it’s outside their remit</li>
      <li>will not investigate the case because it does not have the potential to result in a prohibition order</li>
      <li>will launch a formal investigation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contacting TRA about this referral</h2>
